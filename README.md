# TGBL
A time management tool for games

## Description
The good boy list (TGBL) is a list site where you can manage lists for games that maxamize your efficiency within that game. You can create or follow already created lists that will be able to keep you on task within even the most distracting of environments. Currently, I am developing the ability to track spell slots. After that is complete development will shift to being able to make a list of your characters spells in short form (Tracking damage, effects and area of effect).
