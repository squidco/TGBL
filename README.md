# TGBL
A time management tool for games

## Description
The good boy list (TGBL) is a list site where you can manage lists for games that maxamize your efficiency within that game. You can create or follow already created lists that will be able to keep you on task within even the most distracting of environments. Currently, I am developing the ability to track spell slots. After that is complete development will shift to being able to make a list of your characters spells in short form (Tracking damage, effects and area of effect).

## Usage
Open the site and click the button that says "Spellslots". You will be redirected to the next page which will allow you to create a character by entering their name, level, and highest level spell slot. Upon entering their highest level spell slot a new form will pop up below the original one that will allow you to enter how many spell slots are available for each level of spell. You can then click save and it will take you to the next page which displays your characters spell slots. You may also search for a previously created character instead of creating a new one.
